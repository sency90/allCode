  \title Starting processes with IO redirection
 
  This example shows you how to start other processes with Qt and how 
  IO redirection is done. The example tries to start the uic (a tool
  that comes with the Qt Designer) on a certain ui file and displays the
  output of the command.

  <hr>

  Implementation (process.cpp):
 
  \include process/process.cpp
