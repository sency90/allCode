     Qt/Embedded FREE EDITION 3.3.3 SOURCE CODE

This is release of the Qt/Embedded Free Edition version 3.3.3.

Qt/Embedded Free Edition may only be used to develop Free
(non-proprietary) Software. The LICENSE.GPL file explains what you may
or may not do with the Qt/Embedded Free Edition.

If you are using Qt for developing commercial, proprietary, or other
software not covered by the terms listed in the LICENSE.GPL file, you
must have have a commercial license for Qt/Embedded. Please see
http://www.trolltech.com/purchase.html for how to obtain this. Commercial
Qt editions are also available for Microsoft Windows.  

The INSTALL file explains how to install Qt/Embedded.

If you want to enable built-in GIF image reading support in Qt, run
configure with the "-gif" argument before compiling.

The Qt/Embedded Free Edition is currently supported on Linux Framebuffer.
If you want to port Qt to a new platform, please contact info@trolltech.com

The Qt Reference Documentation is available in HTML format in the
qt/doc/html directory. Start your favorite Web browser with the
doc/html/index.html file. 

If you are new to Qt it is a good idea to read the tutorial. It is located
in doc/html/tutorial.html. The tutorial directory contains the programs
used in the tutorial.

Much of Qt's documentation is available (experimentally) in man page
format and PDF format, but these are never as up-to-date or convenient
as the HTML documentation.

The example programs in the examples directory demonstrate some Qt
features. You can study these examples to get an overview of how Qt
programs can be written, or look at doc/html/examples.html with your
browser.

If you find any bugs, please see information in the reference
documentation about how to report it.
