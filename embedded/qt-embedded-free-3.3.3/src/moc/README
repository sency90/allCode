This directory contains the source code for the Qt Meta Object
Compiler (moc).

The files moc_yacc.cpp, moc_yacc.h and moc_lex.cpp are generated by
yacc and lex from moc.y and moc.l. To compile the moc program from
scratch, you need yacc (or byacc) and lex. These tools are
preinstalled on most Unix systems.

If you run Windows, you can install the Cygwin32 package available at
ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/gnu-win32/win32.

Moc does not compile with GNU bison. Use the standard AT&T yacc or
Berkeley yacc instead.
