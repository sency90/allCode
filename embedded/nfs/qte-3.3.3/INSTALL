			  INSTALLING Qt/Embedded


This installation procedure is written for Linux. It may need to be
modified for other platforms.
 
Unpack the archive if you have not done so already:

cd <anywhere>
gunzip qt-embedded-3.3.3-commercial.tar.gz    # uncompress the archive
tar xf qt-embedded-3.3.3-commercial.tar       # unpack it

This document assumes that the archive is installed as ~/qt-3.3.3

Compile the Qt/Embedded library and examples:

cd ~/qt-3.3.3
export QTDIR=~/qt-3.3.3
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/qt-3.3.3/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
./configure
make

You will require a working Linux framebuffer to use Qt/Embedded.

To run the demo:

cd ~/qt-3.3.3/examples/launcher
./start_demo

See the HTML documentation in doc/html for detailed installation
instructions.

Note for cross-compilation:

Certain tools such as uic run on the host machine and therefore have
to be built natively. The uic tool requires a native Qt library. The
easiest way to do this is to use the uic binary from Qt/X11. Simply copy
path-to-qt-x11/bin/uic to path-to-qt-embedded/bin/uic. You can then
provide an -embedded argument to configure to continue the
cross-platform build process following the procedures detailed in the
HTML documentation.  It is also possible to use the uic binary from a
separate native build of Qt/Embedded.
