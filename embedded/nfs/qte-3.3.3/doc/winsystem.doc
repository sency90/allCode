\title Window System-specific Notes

Qt is a multiplatform GUI toolkit, so almost the entire API is the
same on all platforms and window systems. If you wish to use
platform-specific features, and still maintain a platform-independent
source tree, you should protect the platform-specific code using the
appropriate \c{#ifdef} statements (see below).

\tableofcontents

For information about which platforms are supported by Qt, see the
\link http://www.trolltech.com/products/platforms/ Platform
Notes\endlink. For information on distributing Qt applications, see
\link distributingqt.html Deploying Qt Applications\endlink.

\target x11
\section1 Qt/X11

When compiling for this platform, the macro \c{Q_WS_X11} is defined.

\e{Not documented here. Please contact Trolltech Technical Support
if you have queries.}

\img dependencies.png Qt/X11 Dependencies

Note: You must compile with \e both Xft and XRender support to get
alpha transparency support for pixmaps and images.  Configuring with
XRender support only is not enough.

\target win
\section1 Qt/Windows

When compiling for this platform, the macro \c{Q_WS_WIN} is defined.

\e{Not documented here. Please contact Trolltech Technical Support
if you have queries.}

\target macosx
\section1 Qt/Mac OS X

When compiling for this platform, the macro \c{Q_WS_MACX} is defined.

\target qws
\section1 Qt/Embedded

When compiling for this platform, the macro \c{Q_WS_QWS} is defined
(the window system is literally the Qt Window System).
